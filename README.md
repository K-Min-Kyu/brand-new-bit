# Simplification of TLS 1.3 Handshake

TLS 1.3 has simplified the handshake process compared to TLS 1.2. While this enhancement improves performance, it also raises some security concerns.

## TLS Handshake Process Comparison

### TLS 1.2 Handshake Process
The TLS 1.2 handshake involves six steps:
1. **ClientHello**
2. **ServerHello**
3. **Server Key Exchange**
4. **Client Key Exchange**
5. **Change Cipher Spec**
6. **Finished**
- **TLS 1.2**: Requires **3 steps** to transmit the client's public key.

### TLS 1.3 Handshake Process
The TLS 1.3 handshake is simplified to three steps:
1. **ClientHello**
2. **ServerHello**
3. **Finished**
- **TLS 1.3**: The clientâ€™s public key is transmitted in just **1 step**.

## Security Concerns
The simplified handshake structure of TLS 1.3 can increase vulnerability to **SSL/TLS flood attacks**.  
Attackers can execute SSL/TLS attacks more quickly and easily due to the reduced handshake overhead.
